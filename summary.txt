1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
    For this coding exercise, I opted for a set of tools and libraries that I believe work well together 
    to build a robust and efficient API. Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework, was chosen 
    for its flexibility and features in creating APIs and web servers. Its middleware system and ease of 
    extension were appealing aspects. 

    Jest, a widely used testing framework, and Supertest, an HTTP assertion library, were chosen for efficient
    and comprehensive testing.

    Node.js, the runtime environment, was selected for its capability to execute JavaScript on the server-side,
    making it a suitable choice for building server applications. 

    npm, as the package manager, facilitated easy dependency management and installation.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

    Advantages:
        Discussing first the advantages of the provided solution, it excels in the following areas:
        1. Efficient Transaction Management: The use of a custom linked list for managing transactions
        ensures efficient insertion and removal, particularly for maintaining the order based on
        timestamps. This allows for optimal handling of transactions, supporting the spending and
        addition of points.

        2. Point Tracking by Payer: The implementation effectively tracks points per payer in a dictionary
        (points_per_payer), making it easy to retrieve and update the points associated with each payer.
        This facilitates efficient balance tracking for each payer.
        
        3. Clear Error Handling and Feedback: Error handling within the route handlers is thorough and
        provides clear feedback to the client in case of invalid requests or erroneous actions. This ensures
        a good user experience and aids in debugging and troubleshooting.

        4. Express.js Integration and Middleware Usage: Leveraging Express.js for handling routes and using
        appropriate middleware like body-parser enhances the application's capability to handle HTTP requests
        effectively. This integration follows industry-standard practices.
        
        5. Scalability and Potential for Future Enhancements: The modular and organized design allows for
        easy expansion and potential enhancements. It provides a strong foundation that can accommodate additional
        features or increased complexity as the application evolves.

    Disadvantages:
        Of course, while the solution succeeds in providing the desired functionality, the disadvantages must be
        acknowledged:
        1. Error Handling: Managing the complexity of error handling——specifically in scenarios involving
        negative payer points——could pose a challenge for code maintainability.
        
        2 Synchronous Processing: The synchronous processing of requests could prove a severe hindrance on performance in I/O-bound
        operations, prompting consideration for asynchronous processing. 
        
        3. Scalability: The current design is optimized for single-user applications based on the project's specifications, and may
        not be well-suited for scenarios involving multiple concurrent users or high scalability requirements——the
        architecture and data handling might encounter performance issues and resource limitations when dealing with a
        large number of users or a high volume of transactions.

        4. Security: The current application lacks crucial security measures such as input validation, authentication, and
        authorization. For a production environment, it is imperative to integrate these security features to enhance
        the application's resilience against potential vulnerabilities and malicious attacks.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?

One of my favorite personal projects to date has been the creation of my own portfolio website. This project has been significant
as it allows me to showcase my skills, experiences, and interests in one centralized platform. The website serves as a
representation of my capabilities, acting as a digital resume for potential employers or collaborators.

The challenges encountered during this project were both technical and creative. Firstly, diving into HTML5 to structure the
content of the website was a learning curve. I needed to grasp the fundamentals of HTML to ensure the content was appropriately
organized and presented. Understanding semantic elements and how to style them for an appealing layout was crucial.

Additionally, leveraging React and Bootstrap for the website's frontend presented its own set of challenges. Integrating React
components effectively while ensuring a seamless user experience required me to deepen my understanding of React's state
management, component lifecycle, and event handling. Bootstrap further introduced me to responsive design principles, enabling
the website to look attractive and function well across various devices and screen sizes.

On the non-technical side, designing an aesthetically pleasing and coherent website was a creative challenge. Balancing colors,
typography, and layout to achieve a visually appealing design while aligning with my personal brand was an iterative and
thought-provoking process.

Furthermore, setting up my own domain and deploying the website involved understanding domain registration, DNS settings,
and web hosting. This was a significant step towards real-world application, enhancing my knowledge of how websites are hosted
and accessed on the internet.

Overall, my experience working on my personal portfolio website has been incredibly rewarding. This project has seamlessly
combined technical learning with creative design, and while the website is still a work in progress with its share of
imperfections, these shortcomings serve as valuable opportunities for growth and improvement. So, despite its current state of
refinement, the project stands as a testament to my journey of learning and growth, showcasing my abilities and potential
in the digital space.
